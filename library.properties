sentence=Header-only RC link with iBUS/SBUS transports, shaping/filters, JSON config, and easy failsafe/signature helpers.
paragraph=RCLink is a clean, dependency-light RC link for Arduino/ESP32. It includes robust iBUS and SBUS transports, per-channel mapping and shaping (deadband, expo, invert, EMA), epsilon suppression, receiver-failsafe signature detection, and a tiny ArduinoJson-based loader. New: RcMacros adds one-line failsafe signature macros and helper builders.
